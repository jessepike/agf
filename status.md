---

# Status — AGF

## Handoff — 2026-04-25 (Path A public-readiness pass + M03 pass 5 verification)

**From:** CPO session (Opus) — autonomous Path A execution + Codex verification
**To:** Next session (→ F33 adopter case study coordination is the single remaining structural item bounding M03)
**Tree state:** clean post-wrap; **3 commits push-pending** (`cdea367`, `91b7183`, plus this wrap commit).

**What shipped this session (3 commits):**

1. `cdea367` **feat(diagram+content): Path A public-readiness pass** — confidence-marker audit across 4 previously-unmarked flagship pages (`agentic-observability.mdx` ×2, `governance-decision-record.mdx` Standards Alignment block, `trust-ladders.mdx`, `decision-intelligence.mdx`); transition-state catch-22 caveats removed from `what-is-agf.mdx` + `ai-engineering.mdx`; `composition-patterns.png` regenerated as true 4-pattern progression with hardening-posture modifier band (Gemini-3-pro-image-preview, $0.039); retired `implementation-phases-roadmap.png` superseded; `paywalled` added to cspell. Pre-push gate green. Closes G5-F32.
2. `91b7183` **docs(meta): G5-M03 pass 5 verification + roadmap freshness fix** — Codex (gpt-5.4) Path A verification pass returned 7/10 / `pattern-persists`; same-session resolution of pass-5 child #1 (stale Roadmap "Now (in flight)" still showed Path A pre-shipment) via Roadmap restructure adding "Recently shipped" section listing public-readiness pass / AI Engineering alignment / Transparency surfaces / GDR canonical artifact.
3. (this wrap) **chore: session wrap — Path A handoff + lessons + ledger pass-5 detail block** — findings-ledger.md updated with full pass-5 reviewer block + Path A net-effect summary line; status/BACKLOG/lessons synced.

**Codex pass 5 verbatim (qualitative score floor):**

> "I would cite AGF for architecture framing, gate semantics, and governance-pattern design. I would not yet cite it as externally validated evidence of what works in production."

Score floor is honest. Without adopter case studies, Public Readiness is structurally bounded at 7/10 regardless of editorial work.

**Findings ledger end-state:**

- **Validated:** 17 (unchanged)
- **Resolved (pending validation):** 20 (was 19; +F32 from Path A)
- **Open:** 1 (MI-F07 mechanical residual)
- **Accepted (continuous quality dimension):** 1 (G5-M03 — F33 sole remaining structural blocker)
- **Deferred:** 4 (was 5; F32 promoted to resolved)

**M03 closure path simplified:**

After Path A: only **F33 (first adopter case study)** remains as the structural blocker. Cannot be manufactured editorially. Closure unlocks when at least one published implementation walkthrough lands.

**Tier 1 next:**

- **Push 3 unpushed commits** (`cdea367`, `91b7183`, wrap commit) once user is ready to deploy
- **F33 adopter case study** — coordinate with whoever is piloting AGF; even a partial walkthrough closes M03
- **MI-F07 markdownlint hygiene** — only remaining open finding; non-blocking

**Tier 2:**

- "Agentic Compliance Blind Spots" 10-gap analysis (Roadmap "Now")
- GDR machine-form artifacts (Roadmap "Next") — schema validators, FAIR-CAM templates
- Maturity-level conformance criteria (Roadmap "Next") — concrete L1→L5 testable advancement criteria

---

## Handoff — 2026-04-25 (autonomous Tier 2 → ai-engineering rewrite → GDR sync → dual-form audit → M03 4-pass closeout)

**From:** CPO session (Opus) — autonomous run through queued backlog
**To:** Next session (→ Roadmap "public-readiness pass" + first adopter case study; either unlocks final M03 closure)
**Tree state:** clean post-commit; **5 commits push-pending.**

**What shipped this session (6 commits):**

1. `aca778c` **feat(site): Transparency section** — 4 new MDX routes under `/docs/transparency/` (changelog, decisions, roadmap, contribute). Site grows from 29 → 33 routes. Closes BACKLOG "Site pages — deferred from release-infrastructure session" + extends with /roadmap + /contribute.
2. `1166b3e` **docs(profiles): retire Phase 1–5 in AI Engineering profile** — both canonical (`docs/profiles/ai-engineering-profile.md`) and site MDX rewritten to use 4 canonical Composition Patterns + hardening posture modifier per D10(a). "Secure Governed System" demoted to posture language. Closes BACKLOG "Profile-page phases → patterns alignment."
3. `a095608` **docs(site): sync GDR cross-doc into grc + observability MDX** — mirrors canonical 157b466. `gate_triggered`/`gate_resolved`/`approval_*` events carry `decision_id`; #11 promotion/demotion noted as Domain Outcomes emitting GDRs. Closes BACKLOG "Cross-doc integration passes for GDR."
4. `7245094` **docs(primitives): per-signal dual-form table on Composability Interface + #11 Trust Ladder GDR-on-transition spec** — D17 follow-on closeout. Per-signal emission table (PASS / REVISE-quality / REVISE-context / HALT / GATE / DELEGATE / ERROR / Domain Outcome) specifying observability-event vs GDR emission profile. #11 trust transitions now have explicit GDR field requirements.
5. `e0ce809` **docs(meta): G5-M03 closeout pass 1** — Codex security/GRC persona returned 7/10 / `pattern-persists`; G5-F23/F24/F25 spawned + same-session-resolved (changelog external-reader voice; roadmap public deliverables; relationship-to-frameworks current-vs-planned).
6. `8263964` **docs(meta): G5-M03 closeout passes 2 + 3** — Codex standards-body + practicing-engineer personas, both 7/10 / `pattern-persists`; G5-F26..F31 spawned + same-session-resolved (reference-impl contradiction; "every claim" overclaim; second `/#roles` instance; skeletal index; planned-language reference docs).
7. `65a722d` **docs(meta): G5-M03 closeout pass 4 — accepted as continuous quality dimension** — Codex technical-lead persona, 4th consecutive 7/10. Codex itself: "G5-M03 is behaving like a continuous quality dimension rather than something one more tight editorial pass can honestly close." G5-F32 (transition-state leakage — catch-22 with F27 honest disclosure) + G5-F33 (adoption-proof gap) deferred to Roadmap as structural items.

**Findings ledger end-state:**

- **Validated:** 17 (unchanged this session — meta closeout work doesn't move children to validated)
- **Resolved (pending validation):** 19 (was 10) — adds F23, F24, F25, F26, F27, F28, F29, F30, F31 (M03 children) + F18 already-resolved
- **Open:** 1 (MI-F07 mechanical residual)
- **Accepted (continuous quality dimension):** 1 (G5-M03 — staged for closure when Roadmap public-readiness pass ships AND first adopter case study lands)
- **Accepted / queued:** 1 (G5-F14)
- **Deferred:** 5 (was 3) — adds G5-F32, G5-F33 from M03 pass 4

**Scorecard projection (pending external re-rating):**

- Public Readiness 7/10 (Codex-confirmed, 4 passes converged) — score is structurally bounded above until adoption proof + audit completion
- Other dimensions per 2026-04-24 baseline; no targeted shifts this session
- Composite ~7.5–7.75 (held flat from 2026-04-24 projection)

**M03 closure path:**

M03 closes when both:
1. **Roadmap "public-readiness pass" item ships** — drops the audit-in-flight caveats added during pass 2 F27 fix (catch-22 dissolves)
2. **At least one adopter case study lands** — closes F33 adoption-proof gap

Neither is a single-session task. Both are tracked on `/docs/transparency/roadmap`.

**Tier 1 next:**

- **Push 6 unpushed commits** (aca778c → 65a722d) once user wants to deploy
- **Roadmap "public-readiness pass" execution** — complete the confidence-marker audit across all flagship pages so the in-flight caveat can be removed (closes F32)
- **First adopter case study** — coordinate with whoever is piloting AGF; even a partial walkthrough closes F33
- **MI-F07 markdownlint hygiene** — only remaining open finding; non-blocking since pre-push gate doesn't lint canonical `docs/*.md`

**Tier 2:**

- Diagram regen — `composition-patterns.png` to true four-pattern progression replacing retired `implementation-phases-roadmap.png`; queued for next diagram batch
- "Agentic Compliance Blind Spots" 10-gap analysis (Roadmap "Next") — operationalizes the gap-disclosure commitment in relationship-to-frameworks
- GDR machine-form artifacts (Roadmap "Next") — schema validators, FAIR-CAM templates, evaluation rubric schemas
- Maturity-level conformance criteria (Roadmap "Next") — concrete L1→L5 testable advancement criteria

## Handoff — 2026-04-24 (M01 + M02 → validated via two-pass closeout convergence)

**From:** CPO session (Opus) — second-pass meta closeout via Codex new-adopter persona
**To:** Next session (→ **G5-M03 strategic-meta closeout**, requires Public Readiness ≥8/10 by independent reviewer; OR Tier 2 quick wins)
**Tree state:** clean post-commit; pending push.

**What shipped this session (single ledger commit):**

- **M01 second-pass closeout:** Codex (gpt-5.4, new-adopter persona) read the post-F21 artifact cold and returned `pattern-closed`. Rationale: confidence levels visible in main orientation path, speculative commitments labeled, numeric claims dated/caveated, primitives have attribution table. Dominant posture is now bounded — "synthesis not invention," "planned not shipped," "informed/open where unproven." No new children.
- **M02 second-pass closeout:** Same reviewer, same persona, against post-F22/F18 artifact. Returned `pattern-closed`. Rationale: many named constructs remain (AGF's style) but the ordering primitives (Core Concepts, First 30 Days, reference walkthrough) materially reduce term stacking by sequencing concepts. Reader path no longer leads with taxonomy. No new children.
- **Convergence under scaling rule:** Two passes per meta with different framings (generic-reviewer + new-adopter) produced `pattern-persists` → `pattern-closed`. Per `docs/reviews/README.md` scaling rule for High-severity public-credibility/coherence metas, this satisfies the multi-reviewer requirement.
- **Both M01 + M02 → `validated`.** Validated count 15 → 17.

**Scorecard impact (projected, pending re-rating):**

- Coherence 6 → projected **8** (M02 close + Cohesion Pass v0.3 cumulative effect on naming density)
- Credibility 6 → projected **8** (M01 close + Cluster B/C + Credibility Pass v0.3 cumulative)
- Public Readiness 7 → projected **8** (artifact unevenness materially reduced — F12/F13 add concrete actionability, F18/F22 reduce taxonomy-first feel, F03/F20/F21 add evidence posture)
- Composite ~7.25–7.5 (post-Credibility) → projected **~7.75** (pending external re-score)

**Findings ledger state after this session:**

- **Validated:** 17 (adds G5-M01, G5-M02)
- **Resolved (pending validation):** 10 (unchanged)
- **Open:** G5-M03 (strategic-meta — gated on Public Readiness ≥8/10 independent re-score), MI-F07 (residual editorial)

**Tier 1 next:** **G5-M03 strategic-meta closeout** — requires both qualitative re-read AND quantitative scorecard re-score at Public Readiness ≥8/10 by independent reviewer (per protocol Strategic-meta rule). Recommended sequencing: ship Tier 2 quick wins first (transparency pages, ai-engineering profile rewrite) so the M03 reviewer reads the most-complete artifact, then run a single combined re-score + closeout pass with Codex or fresh Sonnet.

**Tier 2 quick wins (do first):** Transparency pages — `/changelog`, `/decisions`, `/roadmap`, `/contribute` MDX routes (1h Sonnet) · ai-engineering profile rewrite to retire Phase 1-5 H3 headings + regenerate 4-pattern progression diagram (2h Sonnet, pairs with the AI Engineer audience that just got served by Cluster D pages).

**Tier 3 deferred:** MI-F07 deeper markdownlint hygiene on canonical `docs/*.md` — non-blocking since pre-push gate doesn't lint that surface. Editorial-pass-of-opportunity, not scheduled.

## Handoff — 2026-04-24 (M01 closeout pass + G5-F21 spawned/resolved)

**From:** CPO session (Opus) — orchestrated independent closeout via Codex
**To:** Next session (→ **Tier 2: G5-F18 + MI-F07 editorial pass**, Sonnet, 2h)
**Tree state:** clean post-commit; pending push.

**What shipped this session (single commit):**

- **M01 closeout pass executed** by Codex CLI (gpt-5.4) as Strong-tier independent reviewer. Verdict: **`pattern-persists`** with new child G5-F21 filed. Rationale: hot-spot improvements landed but framework-wide posture still uneven — bare current-state empirical claims remain on flagship overview pages despite homepage's "every claim grounded" promise.
- **G5-F21 filed and resolved same session.** Three claims fixed: `rings-model.mdx:8` ("most agentic systems in production today have no structural governance"), `rings-model.mdx:26` ("Most deployed agentic systems today are Ring-0-only"), `what-is-agf.mdx:14` ("Most deployments today are brittle"). All three now carry inline `<Confidence level="informed" />` matching the composition-patterns precedent.
- **Findings ledger:** F21 added + resolved; M01 detail block now contains full closeout-pass note with Codex verdict, scope read, rationale, and next-step recommendation. M01 stays `accepted` pending second independent reviewer per scaling rule (High-severity meta affecting public credibility requires multiple reviewers).

**Method note:** This is the first M01-class closeout pass executed under the protocol canonized in `docs/reviews/README.md` 2026-04-24. The protocol worked exactly as designed — independent reviewer caught real residual pattern that primary author would have missed, surfaced a concrete new child, and the verdict mapped cleanly to existing lifecycle states without requiring protocol changes.

**Scorecard impact (projected, pending re-rating):**

- Credibility 6 → projected **8** (Pass v0.3 + F21 batch — covers all known bare empirical claims on overview)
- No further dimension shifts from this commit (closeout is governance, not new content)

**Findings ledger state after this session:**

- **Validated:** 15 (unchanged)
- **Resolved (pending validation):** 8 → adds G5-F21
- **Open:** G5-F18 (editorial), MI-F07 (residual), G5-M02/M03 (meta)
- **Accepted (post-closeout-pass):** G5-M01 — awaits second independent reviewer

**Tier 1 next:** **G5-F18 + MI-F07 editorial pass** — Sonnet, 2h. Slogan density reduction across flagship MDX + remaining markdownlint hygiene. Unlocks G5-M02 closeout. Recommendation: bundle a second M01 reviewer pass (fresh Sonnet session, post-editorial) to convert M01 `accepted` → `validated` if pattern-closed converges with Codex.

**Tier 2 quick wins:** Transparency pages (1h) · ai-engineering profile rewrite (2h).

**Tier 3 deferred:** G5-M03 strategic-meta closeout (requires Public Readiness ≥8/10 by independent reviewer).

## Handoff — 2026-04-24 (Credibility Pass v0.3 shipped — G5-F03 + F20 resolved)

**From:** CPO session (Opus) — Credibility Pass v0.3 immediately following Cluster D
**To:** Next session (→ **G5-M01 closeout** as Tier 1 — see below)
**Tree state:** clean post-commit; pending push.

**What shipped this session (single commit):**

- `relationship-to-frameworks.mdx` — AICM 5/243 claim wrapped in `<Confidence level="established" />` with verification date 2026-04-24; Agent 365 reference rewritten to "announced; GA target May 2026 per Microsoft Ignite 2025; verify current status on Microsoft Learn" (closes G5-F20); "Organizations adopting AGF typically implement both" wrapped in `<Confidence level="open">` block flagging absence of adopter data.
- `composition-patterns.mdx` — empirical reference points (Microsoft AGT / Bifrost) now in `<Confidence level="established">` block with full source attribution + dates; "most organizations" / "most regulated deployments" claims now carry `<Confidence level="informed" />`.
- `rings-model.mdx` — "more governance than most organizations have today" carries `<Confidence level="informed" />`.
- `trust-ladders.mdx` — Empirical Evidence section now carries section-level `<Confidence level="established" />` qualifier; all four research citations now read "published Month YYYY" with verification guidance.
- `governance-framework.mdx` — overhead multiplier table now followed by `<Confidence level="informed">` block labeling them as design-target estimates not validated benchmarks.
- Findings ledger: F03 + F20 marked resolved; F14 narrowed to infra-shipped/content-gated; open count 4 → 2.

**Scorecard impact (projected, pending re-rating):**

- Credibility 6 → **8 likely** (was the lever this session targeted; dogfooded confidence markers on all flagged claims)
- Public Readiness 7 → **8 likely** (artifact unevenness reduces further)
- Composite ~6.75–7.0 (post-Cluster-D projection) → **~7.25–7.5** likely

**Findings ledger state after this session:**

- **Validated:** 15 (unchanged)
- **Resolved (pending validation):** 7 → G5-F09/F15/F16 (Cohesion) + G5-F12/F13 (Cluster D) + G5-F03/F20 (Credibility)
- **Open:** G5-F18 (editorial), MI-F07 (residual), G5-M01/M02/M03 (meta — now M01 triggerable)

**Tier 1 next:** **G5-M01 meta closeout.** Per `docs/reviews/README.md` Meta-Finding Closeout Protocol, M01 (umbrella for F03/F04/F05/F14) is now triggerable — F03/F04/F05 resolved, F14 infra-shipped/content-gated. Run a holistic re-read with an independent reviewer (Codex CLI or fresh Sonnet); verdict expected `pattern-shifted` toward `pattern-closed` (the dogfooded confidence-marker discipline directly addresses the meta-pattern of "promising rigor without showing it"). 1-2h Sonnet or Codex.

**Tier 2:** G5-F18 + MI-F07 editorial pass — Sonnet, 2h. Slogan density + remaining markdownlint hygiene. Unlocks G5-M02 closeout.

**Tier 3 quick wins:** Transparency pages (1h Sonnet) · ai-engineering profile rewrite (2h Sonnet).

**Tier 4 deferred:** G5-M03 closeout requires Public Readiness re-score ≥8/10 by independent reviewer per strategic-meta rule. Likely triggerable after F18 + ai-engineering rewrite.

## Handoff — 2026-04-24 (Cluster D Actionability shipped — G5-F12 + F13 resolved)

**From:** CPO session (Opus) — Cluster D content shaping
**To:** Next session (→ **Credibility Pass v0.3**, Sonnet, ~3-4h, see Tier 2 below)
**Tree state:** Clean after commit. Origin/main pending push.

**What shipped this session (single commit):**

- New page `agf-docs/content/docs/overview/first-30-days.mdx` — week-by-week MVC starter workplan: prerequisites, four week sections (Inventory & Scope / Identity & Attribution / Provenance & Observability / Scoped Environment & Review), exit criteria to Validation Pipeline + Governed Decision Flow, "What MVC is Not" boundary block. Closes **G5-F12**.
- New page `agf-docs/content/docs/overview/reference-walkthrough.mdx` — one threaded refund scenario ($450 with adaptive-gate override) traced through Rings 0–3 with two GDR YAML examples, six-row threaded view table mapping step → ring → primitive → artifact → observability event, and a candor section under `<Confidence level="informed">` flagging where the walkthrough simplifies. Closes **G5-F13**.
- Nav wiring: `overview/meta.json` extended; cross-links added from `core-concepts.mdx` "What to read next" and `composition-patterns.mdx` "Where to Start" callout.
- cspell dictionary extended (`workplan`, `unauditable`); markdownlint clean; link-check passes; `pnpm build` green (21 prerendered paths).

**Scorecard impact (projected, pending independent re-rating):**

- **Actionability 4 → 7+ likely** (the only stuck dimension; both G5-F12 and G5-F13 directly target it)
- Differentiation 7 → likely 8 (end-to-end walkthrough was the missing concrete differentiation move)
- Public Readiness 7 → likely 8 (artifact unevenness reduces — overview now has both onboarding ramp and reference walkthrough)
- Composite ~6.38 → projected ~6.75–7.0

**Findings ledger state after this session:**

- **Validated:** 15 (unchanged)
- **Resolved (pending validation):** 5 → G5-F09, F15, F16 (Cohesion Pass v0.3) + G5-F12, F13 (Cluster D)
- **Open:** G5-F18 (editorial), MI-F07 (residual), G5-M01/M02/M03 (meta)

**Tier 1 next (highest leverage):** **Credibility Pass v0.3** (G5-F03 + F14 + F20) — Sonnet, 3-4h. Now the only remaining content lever; runs against the freshly shipped Cluster D pages too. When complete, unlocks G5-M01 closeout per Meta-Finding Closeout Protocol.

**Tier 2:** G5-F18 + MI-F07 editorial pass — Sonnet, 2h. Slogan density reduction across flagship MDX + remaining markdownlint hygiene. Unlocks G5-M02 closeout.

**Tier 3 quick wins:** Transparency pages (`/changelog`, `/decisions`, `/roadmap`, `/contribute`) — 1h Sonnet. ai-engineering profile rewrite (retire Phase 1-5 H3) — 2h Sonnet, pairs cleanly with Cluster D pages on AI Engineer audience.

**Tier 4 meta closeouts:** G5-M01 after Credibility Pass · G5-M02 after F18/MI-F07 editorial · G5-M03 after Credibility + F18 + Public Readiness independent re-score ≥8/10.

---

## Handoff — 2026-04-24 (evening close — Cohesion Pass v0.3 shipped + ledger closeout)

**From:** agf-architect session — Sonnet 4.5 + Codex (gpt-5.4) independent review
**To:** Next session (→ **Cluster D Actionability, Opus**, see Tier 1 below)
**Tree state:** Clean. Origin/main at `bb56f93`. GitHub Actions smoke workflow fires on every push to `main`.

**What shipped this session (5 commits):**

| Commit | Summary |
|---|---|
| `eaef524` | Canonical Cohesion Pass — DECISIONS.md #10 (a/b/c): 4 composition patterns + "Secure Governed System" demoted to hardening-posture modifier; governance 5-sense qualifier table; observability 3-layer disambiguation. Closes G5-F09, F15, F16 |
| `23588d9` | F15 qualifier audit on `composition-patterns.mdx` (4 Ring-2 sense fixes + orphan `implementation-phases-roadmap.png` retired); `DIAGRAM-SPECS` entry 2 marked SUPERSEDED; BACKLOG entry for ai-engineering profile rewrite (still has "Phase 1-5" H3 headings) |
| `b1366cd` | MI-F07 partial — bulk MD032 auto-fix across 21 canonical docs + 10 flagship MD040 tags |
| `076393f` | Session wrap (initial) — status.md + lessons.md handoff text |
| `bb56f93` | Ledger closeout — DECISIONS.md #11 (LICENSE CC BY 4.0 canonized retroactively from 2026-04-23 operational confirmation) + BACKLOG P0 blocker cleared |

**Key session insight — discovered prior-session incumbent work in-progress.** Upon git status inspection, found 8 files + D10 draft left uncommitted from a prior (unseen) 2026-04-24 session that started the Cohesion Pass with **5-pattern canonicalization** but then pivoted mid-flight to **4-pattern + hardening posture** on the MDX edits without updating D10/CHANGELOG/shared-vocabulary. My independent Codex review converged on Path C (4 patterns + posture), matching the incumbent MDX. Reconciliation was: fix the lagging decision records to match what the MDX already said; restore lost shared-vocabulary disambiguation sections I accidentally destroyed via a `git checkout` before I realized the incumbent work existed. Lessons captured to `lessons.md` + agent state.

**Scorecard impact (projected, pending independent re-rating):**

- Coherence 6 → **7+ likely** (F09 + F15 + F16 all resolved; naming-density relieved by Secure Governed demotion; observability taxonomy made explicit)
- Mechanical 7 → unchanged (MI-F07 partial; canonical docs not on pre-push gate path)
- Actionability 4 → unchanged (Cluster D not touched)
- Other dimensions unchanged

**Findings ledger state after this session:**

- **Validated:** 15 (unchanged)
- **Resolved (pending validation):** 3 → G5-F09, F15, F16 (Cohesion Pass v0.3)
- **Partial:** MI-F07 (bulk format fixed; deeper MD040 remains non-blocking)
- **Open:** G5-F12, F13 (Cluster D), G5-F18 (editorial), G5-M01/M02/M03 (meta)

**P0 blockers:** none. LICENSE resolved via D11.

**M02 meta closeout — NOT yet runnable.** Protocol triggers when all children in stable non-open state. F09/F15/F16 resolved; F18 still deferred (editorial pass). Closeout runs AFTER F18 ships. Expected verdict when run: `pattern-shifted` toward `pattern-closed` (Secure Governed demotion was the highest-leverage density-relief move).

---

## Next Tranche — Prioritized

**Tier 1 — Highest strategic impact (do next):**

1. **Cluster D Actionability (G5-F12 + F13)** — **Opus · 3–4h · biggest single lever.** Actionability is the only stuck dimension (4/10). It caps further gains on Differentiation and Public Readiness. Shipping the 30-day MVC starter path + end-to-end reference walkthrough breaks the ceiling. Opus recommended for strategic content shaping. *Independent of everything else in this list — start here.*

**Tier 2 — Complementary, ship together as v0.3 content release:**

2. **Credibility Pass v0.3 (G5-F03 + F14 + F20)** — **Sonnet · 3–4h.** Audit flagship pages for numeric/empirical claims; apply `<Confidence>` markers at the claim level; add dated-source annotations on time-sensitive claims. Enables G5-M01 closeout when complete.
3. **G5-F18 + MI-F07 full editorial pass** — **Sonnet or fresh reader · 2h.** Slogan density reduction + remaining markdownlint hygiene on deeper docs. Subjective editorial; benefits from fresh eyes. Enables G5-M02 closeout when complete.

**Tier 3 — Quick wins, slottable anywhere:**

4. **Transparency pages** — **Sonnet · 1h.** Expose `/changelog`, `/decisions`, `/roadmap`, `/contribute` as MDX routes. Pure execution, no strategy decisions.
5. **ai-engineering profile rewrite** — **Sonnet · 2h.** Retire "Phase 1-5" H3 headings (per BACKLOG entry); pair with regenerated 4-pattern progression diagram. Fits naturally alongside Cluster D (both touch AI Engineer audience).

**Tier 4 — Meta closeouts (protocol-gated, run AFTER their trigger passes):**

6. **G5-M01 closeout** — runs after Credibility Pass v0.3 ships. Requires holistic re-read + reviewer independence per Meta-Finding Closeout Protocol.
7. **G5-M02 closeout** — runs after F18 editorial ships.
8. **G5-M03 closeout** — runs after Clusters D + Credibility + F18 all land. Requires Public Readiness dimension re-score ≥8/10 by independent reviewer per strategic-meta rule in `docs/reviews/README.md`.

**Validation queued for next Mode C pass:** G5-F09, F15, F16 — verify D10 claims hold by reading the canonical docs + cited artifacts.

## Previous Handoffs

## Handoff — 2026-04-24 (close — 5 commits pushed to origin) — SUPERSEDED

**From:** agf-architect session — Sonnet 4.6 + Codex (gpt-5.4) collaboration
**To:** Next session (model tier depends on path chosen — see sequencing below)
**Tree state:** Clean. Origin/main at `9af96c5`. GitHub Actions smoke workflow will fire post-deploy automatically.

**What shipped this session (5 commits):**

| Commit | Summary |
|---|---|
| `532aa91` | Ledger Mode C validation pass — 15 findings validated, counter drift fixed, MI-F04/F05 detail-state reconciled |
| `cf807cc` | Session wrap — validation outcome captured in status/lessons |
| `bd7d32c` | Codex handoff — meta-finding closeout protocol draft at `.private/drafts/` |
| `ed07ba7` | Rings-model v6 canonical — supersedes v1, prompt archived in DIAGRAM-SPECS, site copy synced, BACKLOG rings-model + MI-F03/F04/F05 closed |
| `9af96c5` | Meta-finding closeout protocol canonized to `docs/reviews/README.md` with cross-ref from `docs/findings-ledger.md` |

**New AGF canon:** Meta-finding closeout protocol. Lives at `docs/reviews/README.md § Meta-Finding Closeout Protocol`. Three verdicts (`pattern-closed` / `pattern-persists` / `pattern-shifted`) map onto existing lifecycle. Tiered reviewer independence (Strong/Acceptable/Weak) with scaling rule — higher-stakes metas require multiple reviewers with different models. Strategic-meta rule: G5-M03 and any dimension-tied meta require BOTH re-read AND scorecard re-score at ≥8/10 by independent reviewer. `pattern-persists` requires at least one new concrete child filed (no rationale-only hold-open).

**Scorecard (unchanged from 6.38/10 — this session was validation + governance, not content):**
Clarity 7 · Coherence 6 · Defensibility 7 · Differentiation 7 · **Actionability 4 (stuck)** · Credibility 6 · Public Readiness 7 · Mechanical 7

**Next session sequence (agf-architect recommendation — unchanged from earlier in session; Jesse deferred on pick):**

1. **Cohesion Pass v0.3** (G5-F09, F15, F16, F18 + M02) — 3–4h · Opus for vocabulary decisions then Sonnet for editorial execution
2. **Transparency pages** (`/changelog`, `/decisions`, `/roadmap`, `/contribute`) — 1h · Sonnet · independent
3. **Cluster D — Actionability** (G5-F12, F13) — 3–4h · Opus · reference walkthrough + 30-day MVC path
4. **Credibility Pass v0.3** (G5-F03, F14, F20 + M01) — 3–4h · Sonnet · runs last

**Rationale for Cohesion-first:** vocabulary decisions in F09/F15/F16 are prerequisites for clean Cluster D prose. Cohesion-before-content is the general principle.

**Meta-finding closeout triggers (none ready yet):**
- G5-M01 (rigor promise) — triggerable after Credibility Pass v0.3 ships
- G5-M02 (naming density) — triggerable after Cohesion Pass v0.3 ships
- G5-M03 (public readiness) — triggerable after both + Cluster D; also requires Public Readiness re-score at ≥8/10 by independent reviewer

**No open blockers. No residual housekeeping.**

## Handoff — 2026-04-24 (Codex meta-finding closeout protocol draft) — SUPERSEDED

Meta-finding closeout protocol draft landed in `.private/drafts/meta-finding-closeout-protocol-codex.md` during session; canonized via Jesse's decisions to `docs/reviews/README.md` in commit `9af96c5`. Open decisions (fresh-eyes tier, ledger field, scorecard threshold) all resolved — see top-of-file handoff for applied answers.

---

## Handoff — 2026-04-24 (agf-architect Mode C validation + sequence recommendation)

**From:** agf-architect (Sonnet 4.6) — short session following 2026-04-23 evening handoff
**To:** Next session (model depends on path — see sequence recommendation below)
**Context:** Executed handoff path 1 (Mode C batch validation) against the 15 findings resolved 2026-04-23 evening. All 15 validated, no regressions. Ledger bookkeeping cleaned up (stale counters, MI-F04/F05 detail-state contradictions). Commit `532aa91` on main, not pushed.

**What shipped:**
- `docs(ledger): validate 15 resolved findings + fix stale counters` (532aa91) — Mode C verdicts, counter corrections, MI-F04/F05 detail state lines, Cluster A trajectory annotation, top-of-doc Validation passes register

**Proposed v0.3 sequence (agf-architect recommendation — Jesse pending decision):**

1. **Cohesion Pass v0.3** (G5-F09, F15, F16, F18 + M02) — 3–4h · Opus for 30-min vocabulary decisions (F09 canonical-model pick, F15 governance-sense audit, F16 observability three-layer spec), then Sonnet for editorial execution
2. **Transparency pages** (`/changelog`, `/decisions`, `/roadmap`, `/contribute`) — 1h · Sonnet · independent, slot anywhere
3. **Cluster D — Actionability** (G5-F12, F13) — 3–4h · Opus · reference walkthrough + 30-day MVC path; biggest differentiation move
4. **Credibility Pass v0.3** (G5-F03, F14, F20 + M01) — 3–4h · Sonnet · runs last; audits whatever's final across all shipped content

**Rationale for Cohesion-first:** G5-F09 (4 patterns vs 5 phases), G5-F15 (governance overload), G5-F16 (observability taxonomy) are dependencies for Cluster D. If Cluster D ships first, Cohesion has to chase rewrites across freshly-shipped content. Cohesion-first gives Cluster D a clean vocabulary substrate.

**If Jesse disagrees** — Cluster D first is defensible (Actionability 4/10 is the most visible gap). Credibility Pass first is defensible (infra shipped; pure execution).

**Meta-findings still open:** G5-M01 (rigor/evidence promise), G5-M02 (naming density), G5-M03 (public-readiness unevenness) — these are holistic patterns, NOT closeable by child validation alone. Need separate holistic re-read pass when v0.3 content passes land.

**Scorecard after this session:** 6.38/10 composite (unchanged — validation doesn't move scores). Clarity 7 · Coherence 6 · Defensibility 7 · Differentiation 7 · **Actionability 4 (stuck)** · Credibility 6 · Public Readiness 7 · Mechanical 7.

**Branch state:** main is 1 commit ahead of origin/main (532aa91). Push at Jesse's discretion.

## Handoff — 2026-04-23 21:45

**From:** Sonnet 4.6 deep working session (Opus-planned, Sonnet-executed)
**To:** Fresh session (next day or later) — model tier depends on task chosen below
**Context:** Four review clusters shipped, composite scorecard 5.25 → 6.38, three-layer release automation live. All commits deployed to agf.jessepike.dev (10b2829 latest). Session exited mid-triage — Clusters D (Actionability) and two v0.3 content passes remain.

**Next actions (pick one path):**

1. **Validate what shipped** — run `claude-agf-architect` and use `/agf-review --validate <F-ID>` against the 13 resolved findings. Catches anything this session's author graded wrong. Best first move if any doubt on the work. ~45 min. Sonnet is fine.
2. **Cluster D — Actionability** (G5-F12, F13, plus BACKLOG items) — real 3-4h workstream: end-to-end reference walkthrough, 30-day Minimum Viable Control starter path, adopter archetypes. Biggest remaining quality lift. **Opus recommended** (strategic content shaping).
3. **v0.3 content release prep** — Credibility Pass + Content Cohesion Pass are both queued in BACKLOG as P1. Each is ~3-4h. Ship together as v0.3. **Sonnet** for both (execution-heavy, strategy already set in ledger).
4. **Transparency pages** (`/changelog`, `/decisions`, `/roadmap`, `/contribute`) — currently Backlogged; recommended promotion to P1. ~1h. **Sonnet**.

**Key files the next session must read:**

- `docs/findings-ledger.md` — full finding state, scorecard trajectory, cluster notes
- `BACKLOG.md` — Credibility Pass v0.3 + Content Cohesion Pass v0.3 + Tooling refinement sections
- `docs/reviews/README.md` — review format spec, rubric, lifecycle
- `docs/release-playbook.md` — three-layer automation now documented here
- `CLAUDE.md` — one-time per-clone: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` if working in a fresh checkout

**Known gotcha:** Pre-push hook activation in THIS clone only. A fresh clone won't have it active. One command fixes it; documented in CLAUDE.md.

**Not shipped this session but worth eyeballing on live site:**
- Homepage hero definition + "What AGF is / is not" grid + Confidence badges
- `/docs/reference/confidence-levels` (now position 2 in Reference nav)
- `/docs/reference/primitives` Primitive Attribution section
- `/docs/overview/core-concepts` new orientation page

**Model recommendation:** **Sonnet 4.6** for paths 1, 3, 4 (execution-heavy; strategic framing already set in `docs/findings-ledger.md` and `BACKLOG.md` — this is content shipping + validation, not strategy). **Opus 4.7** for path 2 (Cluster D Actionability) — reference walkthrough, adopter archetypes, and 30-day starter require strategic content shaping and structural decisions that benefit from Opus depth. Default to **Sonnet** unless going straight to path 2.

**Updated:** 2026-04-23 (evening session)
**Stage:** Operate — v0.2.0 released (2026-04-22); release infrastructure + review process shipped (2026-04-23); 4 deploys live on agf.jessepike.dev; v0.3 content passes queued

## 2026-04-23 (evening session) — Review ingestion, 4 clusters shipped, 3-layer release automation

**What landed (7 commits, all deployed to agf.jessepike.dev):**

- **Review process established** — GPT-5.4 external review ingested verbatim at `docs/reviews/2026-04-23-gpt-5-4.md`; internal mechanical-baseline review at `docs/reviews/2026-04-23-mechanical-baseline.md`; `docs/findings-ledger.md` with F-ID schema, severity × confidence grid, lifecycle states, and trajectory tracking
- **v0.2.0 baseline scorecard:** 5.25/10 composite across 8 dimensions. Current: **6.38/10** (+1.13)
- **Cluster A — Mechanical** (commit `3be6350`): cspell dict populated, markdownlint config fixed (666 → 108 → ~0 errors)
- **Cluster B — Credibility infra** (commit `90964c5` + `f8c7bb1`): `<Confidence>` + `<Status>` MDX components built + registered globally; `/docs/reference/confidence-levels` reference page shipped; homepage Philosophy card dogfoods the gradient; G5-F05 "operationalize at machine speed" wrapped in `<Confidence level="open">` block
- **Cluster C — Defensibility** (commit `1556459`): Primitive Attribution table (19-row lineage) on `/docs/reference/primitives`; Belief Layer novelty claim bounded + confidence-marked; OTAA expanded at first use
- **Cluster E — Clarity quick wins** (commit `54e808d`): homepage CTA anchor fix, canonical one-sentence definition on hero + what-is-agf, "What AGF is / is not" homepage grid, `/docs/overview/core-concepts` orientation page, primitive catalog link fix, observability slug rename
- **Release automation shipped** (commit `3037a6e`): `.github/workflows/smoke.yml` post-deploy smoke on every push to main; pre-push hook activated (`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`); three-layer pipeline documented in CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md + release-playbook.md
- **Tooling blockers resolved** (commit `3afefb4`): pre-push hook activation forced MI-F04 (check-links route resolution) and MI-F05 (lint-mdx fence-awareness) out of "deferred" into "resolved" — both were real release blockers disguised as cosmetic polish. Plus MD032 auto-fixes across 7 files, MD040 fence-language tags, cspell dict extended.
- **Nav discoverability** (commit `10b2829`): confidence-levels promoted to position 2 in Reference sidebar (was buried at 7/7)

**Findings ledger state:**
- 13 resolved (MI-F01, MI-F02, MI-F04, MI-F05, G5-F01, F02, F04, F05, F06, F07, F08, F10, F11, F17, F19)
- 4 accepted / queued → Credibility Pass v0.3 (G5-F03, F14 infra only, F20)
- 4 deferred → Content Cohesion Pass v0.3 (G5-F09, F15, F16, F18)
- Remaining open: G5-F12, F13 (Cluster D actionability lift); G5-M02, M03 (meta, resolve via other findings); MI-F07 (near-zero residual)

**Scorecard progression (v0.2.0 baseline → now):**
- Clarity 5 → 7
- Coherence 6 → 6
- Defensibility 5 → 7
- Differentiation 6 → 7
- Actionability 4 → 4 (unchanged — Cluster D not yet run)
- Credibility 5 → 6
- Public Readiness 5 → 7
- Mechanical 6 → 7

**Original 2026-04-23 infrastructure session (morning):**

## Current State

Agentic Governance Framework v0.1 published. Documentation site live at agf.jessepike.dev. Core framework docs complete. 24 architecture diagrams (3 new macro positioning visuals added 2026-04-21 PM; additional pass in flight 2026-04-22). `DECISIONS.md` active with 9 entries.

**2026-04-23 — Release infrastructure + AGF domain agent scaffolded:**

Built the three buckets from the lifecycle/governance conversation:

**Bucket 1 — Governance scaffolding (this repo):**
- `GOVERNANCE.md` — BDFL model, versioning policy, decision process, evolution path
- `CHANGELOG.md` — Keep-a-Changelog format with retroactive v0.1.0 + v0.2.0 entries
- `VERSION` — `0.2.0`
- `LICENSE-TODO.md` — options flagged (CC-BY-4.0, CC-BY-SA-4.0, Apache-2.0); current LICENSE remains CC BY 4.0, confirmed intentional for adoption-first commercial posture
- `docs/release-playbook.md` — 5-stage pipeline, per-stage detail, rollback procedure
- `docs/tooling-guide.md` — operational reference + sanity tests + troubleshooting

**Bucket 2 — Release scripts (this repo `bin/` + `.githooks/`):**
- `bin/preflight.sh`, `bin/drift-report.mjs`, `bin/sync-to-site.sh`, `bin/lint-mdx.sh`, `bin/check-links.mjs`, `bin/smoke-deployed.mjs`
- `.githooks/pre-push` — 4-stage gate (preflight → lint → links → build)
- One-time setup: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`
- Commit: `c39f412`

**Bucket 3 — `agf-architect` agent + `agf-release` skill (dev system, outside this repo):**
- Agent at `~/code/_shared/pike-agents/plugins/agf-architect/` — thought partner (80%) + release reviewer (20%); 6 slash commands (`/agf-think`, `/agf-review`, `/agf-crosswalk`, `/agf-primitive`, `/agf-surveil`, `/agf-release`)
- Skill at `~/code/tools/ai-dev/skills/agf-release/SKILL.md`
- Shell launcher: `claude-agf-architect` in `~/.zshrc`
- Registered in capabilities-registry
- Entry in `~/code/_shared/pike-agents/CHANGELOG.md`

**Backlog additions (deferred):** CMO-led public peer review program, primitive stability markers, deprecation policy, citation format standard, reference implementations, challenge ledger. See `BACKLOG.md` § "Community + credibility + adoption (NEW 2026-04-23)".

**Quality scoring / multi-agent review cycle (NEW 2026-04-23):** Discussed but deferred. Jesse has a GPT 5.4 review with scoring + findings to be incorporated when we resume this track. Intended shape: separate `agf-quality-review` skill, periodic multi-reviewer cycle (Architect + Standards + Editorial + Practitioner + Adversarial + External Model), scoring rubric across framework consistency / standards accuracy / evidence discipline / completeness / actionability / novelty defensibility / doc quality / mechanical integrity.

**2026-04-22 — GDR primitive promotion (CPO session):**

Promoted Q1 (Governance Decision Record) from change queue to public framework as DECISIONS.md #8 (D16 — Gate Vocabulary Disambiguation) + #9 (D17 — GDR as Canonical Audit Artifact). Three atomic commits:
- `962f2b2` — `feat(decisions): D16 gate vocabulary disambiguation + D17 GDR primitive` — DECISIONS.md rows #5 refined + #8 + #9 added
- `288ddee` — `feat(framework): add Governance Decision Record as canonical audit artifact` — new `docs/governance-decision-record.md` (~440 lines), new `docs/schemas/gdr.yaml` (JSON Schema draft-2020-12), edits to `docs/agentic-primitives.md` (Primitive #8 + Composability Interface inserts), new "Gate Vocabulary" section in `docs/shared-vocabulary.md`, registration in `docs/publication-map.md`
- `078abea` — `docs(consistency): align relationship-to-frameworks gate boundary language with D16/D17` — fixes the D12.4a wording bug propagation in relationship-to-frameworks.md:201

**Process:** Two rounds of Codex external review. Round 1 caught 9 findings (5 accepted unconditionally, 3 accepted with modification, 1 accepted in part). Round 2 caught 5 new defects in v2 (all accepted, biggest = HALT-on-timeout couldn't be modeled because HALT is a Ring Control Signal not a Gate Resolution). Final v3 added five-state lifecycle (`pending / resolved / expired / superseded / aborted`), Lifecycle Invariants table, Default Action on Timeout table, and "Sensitive Content Handling" subsection. EU AI Act Art. 12 + Art. 14 and NIST AI RMF MANAGE 4.1 citations independently verified against primary sources before commit. ISO 42001 clause numbers (7.5/9.3) used with high confidence based on Annex SL but NOT independently verified — logged as backlog item.

**Site update changelist drafted:** `.private/drafts/site-update-changelist.md` — covers all canonical-to-MDX sync needed since 2026-04-21 (v1.0 positioning batch + GDR work + macro diagrams + 3 broken-link fixes from external review + homepage positioning card recommendation). Ready for site manager execution. Estimated 2–4 hours focused effort.

**2026-04-17 — Major positioning work landed in workshop (not yet public):**
- Six-pillar positioning (D12): Category "Agentic Governance" + four verbs (Synthesize/Unify/Prescribe/Operationalize) + OTAA invariant + dual-form principle + tempo taxonomy + NIST CSF parallel
- Seven-layer stack with AGF as architectural substrate at Layer 0 (D13)
- Source extractions from Microsoft (AGT, CAF, Failure Mode Taxonomy, Responsible AI Report, Copilot Studio Gov WP) and CSA (ATF, AICM, MAESTRO, Agentic IAM, Identity Gaps, Securing Autonomous Agents) in `.private/research/extractions-2026-04-17/`

**2026-04-21 PM — Macro positioning visuals generated (CPO session):**

Three high-altitude diagrams produced via diagram-forge (gpt-image-2, quality medium, $0.369 total):

- `diagrams/seven-layer-landscape-stack.png` — AGF as encapsulating container around L1 OWASP → L5 MS AGT stack with Risk Quantification as orthogonal sidebar. Supports DECISIONS #4.
- `diagrams/four-verbs-invariants.png` — Four-verb causal flow (Synthesize → Unify → Prescribe → Operationalize) with shared navy header "EVERY AGF PRIMITIVE MUST:" + BE (OTAA) and PRODUCE (dual-form) peer bands. Supports DECISIONS #3 pillars #2/3/4 and #5.
- `diagrams/reference-architecture-macro.png` — Four concentric rings (Ring 0 center → Ring 3 outermost) with cross-cutting radial sectors (Agentic Observability + Decision Intelligence), 19-primitive legend, NIST CSF Parallel callout. Supports DECISIONS #3 pillar #6.

Canonical prompts saved to `diagrams/DIAGRAM-SPECS.md` for reproducibility.

**2026-04-21 AM — Positioning refinement + promotion complete:**

Workshop session refined positioning, then promoted to public repo in 4 atomic commits:
- `4244707` — `docs(decisions): promote D12-D15 positioning decisions to public DECISIONS.md`
- `bd1b665` — `docs(maturity): rename L1 Awareness to Non-existent; absorb inventory content into L2 Foundation`
- `a2adb27` — `docs(vocabulary): add positioning pillars, harness, maturity, and framework-synthesis terminology`
- `0e04172` — `feat(framework): add relationship-to-frameworks as AGF's canonical position in the governance landscape`

Public artifacts now live:
- `DECISIONS.md` — #3–#7 (positioning pillars, seven-layer stack, gate-boundary dual-form, maturity model, harness definition)
- `docs/relationship-to-frameworks.md` — NEW canonical doc with seven-layer stack, role-based entry points, TOGAF/SABSA context, Trust Ladders↔ATF relationship
- `docs/agentic-governance-framework.md` — maturity model rewritten (L1 Non-existent)
- `docs/shared-vocabulary.md` — 5 new sections (positioning, harness, maturity, identity & credentialing, governance program); standards abbreviations expanded
- `docs/agf-reference-architecture.md` — cross-link added
- `docs/publication-map.md` — Relationship to Frameworks registered
- MDX synced: `agf-docs/content/docs/reference/relationship-to-frameworks.mdx` (new), `governance-framework.mdx` (maturity), `resources/vocabulary.mdx` (vocab)
- `.private/change-queue.md` — Q5 moved to Completed

## Next Steps

1. **Site update execution** — site manager works through `.private/drafts/site-update-changelist.md`. Coordinate with Jesse's parallel diagram work before deploy.
2. **Cross-doc integration passes for GDR** (P1 backlog) — update `docs/profiles/grc-profile.md` Evidence Artifacts table to reference GDR as the format; add GDR `decision_id` reference to observability event payloads in `docs/profiles/observability-profile.md`; RDG → GDR export format spec in `docs/decision-intelligence.md` (P2). Closes the cross-doc coherence loop.
3. **Primitive #8 timeout-behavior prose cleanup** (P1 backlog, NEW from this session) — the canonical doc itself conflates HALT (Ring Control Signal) with ESCALATE (Gate Resolution) in default-action prose. Surfaced by Codex round 2 review while drafting GDR. Revise to describe the three valid default actions (ESCALATE, REJECT, HALT) per the Default Action on Timeout table now in `docs/governance-decision-record.md`.
4. **Original gate-boundary dual-form audit** (was P1) — partially superseded by D17/GDR. Remaining work: audit Composability Interface for dual-form emission per signal type; audit Primitive #11 (Trust Ladders) — promotions/demotions are Domain Outcomes that emit GDRs.
5. **Primitive #14 Identity & Attribution upgrade** — 10-point spec ready in `.private/research/extractions-2026-04-17/ms-docs-and-csa-identity.md` §11
6. **Primitive #15 rename to "Agent SRE"** + SLO/error-budget/chaos additions
7. **Profile doc upgrades:** security-profile MS Failure Mode Taxonomy section + AICM crosswalk; GRC-profile AGF↔ATF maturity crosswalk
8. **Intent.md review** — produce DIFF PROPOSAL (not edit) against new pillars (DECISIONS.md #3)
9. **Content production** via pike-acm (Campaign 03: AGF series C3-003+) — positioning now stable enough to resume; three macro visuals ready to anchor content
10. **Publishable content candidate:** "Agentic Compliance Blind Spots" 10-gap analysis (source: `.private/research/extractions-2026-04-17/aicm-and-ms-failure-modes.md` §14)
11. **Q3 (Tool Governance) promotion** — first GDR domain application; depends on this session's GDR primitive landing (now done). Source: `.private/inbox/AGF-Tool-Governance-v2.md`. Ready when prioritized.
12. **ISO 42001 clause verification** (LOW) — confirm Clauses 7.5 + 9.3 against official ISO text (paywalled); soften GDR doc Standards section if numbers are wrong.

## Blockers / Open Questions

None blocking. Positioning foundation is public and stable.
